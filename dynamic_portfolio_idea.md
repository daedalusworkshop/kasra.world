# Dynamic Portfolio Matching System

## The Idea

What if my portfolio could read someone's LinkedIn or Twitter and automatically show them the projects that would most resonate with them? Like Every Intelligence, but for selling myself to different types of people.

## How It Would Work

1. **Upload social profile** - Visitor pastes their LinkedIn or Twitter
2. **AI analyzes their background** - Extracts their industry, skills, interests, career stage
3. **Smart matching** - Algorithm finds my portfolio pieces most relevant to them
4. **Personalized presentation** - Rewrites project descriptions to highlight what matters to THEM specifically

## The Magic

Instead of everyone seeing the same static portfolio, each person gets a customized experience:

- **Startup founder** sees my AI tools and technical problem-solving
- **Designer** sees my creative projects and design process
- **Developer** sees my technical implementations and code
- **Artist** sees my experimental and creative work
- **Student** sees my learning journey and accessible explanations

## Technical Approach

Borrow from Every Intelligence:
- FastAPI + JavaScript for the interface
- Embeddings search for matching (Pinecone)
- OpenAI for generating personalized explanations
- Social media scraping for profile analysis

## Why This Is Cool

- **Eliminates portfolio browsing friction** - No more "which projects should I look at?"
- **Feels like a conversation** - Portfolio adapts to who you are
- **Demonstrates the work** - The portfolio itself becomes an AI project
- **Memorable experience** - People remember interactive over static

## The Vision

Your portfolio becomes a choose-your-own-adventure that makes every visitor feel like you built it specifically for them. It's not just showing your work - it's showing your work in the context of their world.

*Future implementation: Build this as a web app that could work for any portfolio, not just mine*
