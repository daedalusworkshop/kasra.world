# Poetry Matchmaker

*AI Poetry Discovery Interface | Status: Complete*

Users can either type their thoughts or use the microphone to speak naturally about what they're feeling or thinking about.

### 3. AI Curation Process
- **Wide Net**: Vector search casts across poetry database (50+ poems evaluated)
- **Deep Analysis**: AI reads and evaluates each potential match
- **Relevance Scoring**: Determines emotional and thematic resonance
- **Best Match**: Selects the poem with highest relevance score

### 4. Personalized Results

## Technical Implementation

**Search Strategy:**
- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity
- Large-scale evaluation (50+ candidates per query)
- Contextual relevance scoring
- Explainable recommendations

**Interface Design:**
- Voice-first interaction
- Minimal visual complexity
- Focus on poetry presentation
- Optional explanation layer

## Philosophy

Poetry has always served as a mirror for human experience, but discovering relevant poems traditionally requires extensive reading or lucky encounters. This tool democratizes poetry discovery by making the vast landscape of human poetic expression searchable through natural language and emotional context.

The system doesn't generate new poetry—it curates from humanity's existing poetic wisdom, helping users find voices that speak to their current moment.
