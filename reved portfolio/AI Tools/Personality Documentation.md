## Overview

An exploration of using AI to help document and understand personal frameworks, thinking patterns, and cognitive approaches. This project investigates how AI can serve as a mirror for self-reflection and personality mapping.

## The Approach

Rather than traditional personality assessments, this work uses conversational AI to help identify and articulate implicit thinking patterns, decision-making frameworks, and intellectual tendencies.

## Published Work

**[Mind Mapping](https://kasramikaili.substack.com/p/mind-mapping?r=2bfq50&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)** - A Substack essay exploring the intersection of AI and self-understanding.

## Core Concept

The project explores how AI's ability to reflect patterns back to users can create new forms of self-awareness. By engaging in extended dialogue about thinking processes, decision-making, and intellectual frameworks, users can discover aspects of their personality and cognition that might otherwise remain implicit.

## Applications

- **Personal Development**: Understanding cognitive biases and thinking patterns
- **Team Dynamics**: Mapping communication styles and collaborative approaches  
- **Creative Process**: Identifying artistic and intellectual preferences
- **Decision Making**: Recognizing consistent frameworks and values

## Methodology

Through structured conversations with AI systems, users can:
1. Externalize internal thinking processes
2. Identify recurring patterns and frameworks
3. Gain vocabulary for previously ineffable aspects of personality
4. Develop meta-cognitive awareness

## Status

Currently in development, with initial findings published in the Mind Mapping essay. The project continues to evolve as AI capabilities expand and new applications emerge.
