*AI vs Human Poetry Exhibition | Status: Complete*

## The Experiment

Half of these poems were written by masters of literature.
Half of these were written by AI in thirty seconds.

## The Question

We are going to live in a world where we won't know who created the art—the human or the AI. How will that affect our relationship with beauty?

## Exhibition Concept

This gallery piece presents visitors with a collection of poems without attribution. Readers experience the work purely on its own merit, discovering only afterward which pieces came from human masters and which were generated by AI in moments.

## Philosophical Implications

**Challenging Assumptions:**
- What makes art valuable—the process or the result?
- How much does knowing the creator change our perception?
- Can beauty exist independently of its origin?

**Future of Creativity:**
- In a world of indistinguishable AI and human art, what happens to our cultural relationship with creativity?
- How do we value artistic work when the time investment becomes irrelevant?
- What new forms of authenticity might emerge?

## The Reveal

The project's power lies in the moment of revelation—when viewers discover their assumptions about what "feels human" versus what "feels artificial" may be completely wrong.

This moment forces a confrontation with our biases about creativity, value, and the nature of artistic expression itself.

## Impact

By removing the context of creation, the work allows pure aesthetic experience while simultaneously questioning the frameworks we use to assign cultural and monetary value to art.
