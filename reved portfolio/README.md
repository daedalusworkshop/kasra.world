*AI, Creative Tech, and Human Connection*

## About

The intersection of artificial intelligence, creative expression, and the human experience. Each project investigates how technology can amplify rather than replace human creativity and connection.

## Featured Projects

### AI Tools
- **[[Claude Opens Minds]]** - A specialized prompt that helps users become aware of their implicit frameworks through genuinely different perspectives

## Philosophy

> "The more context you give, the better an AI responds. It's almost exponential. This is an opposite paragon to Google."

My work explores this principle—that AI's greatest potential lies not in replacing human judgment or creativity, but in amplifying it through rich context and thoughtful interaction design.
