# Mr President Case Study

*AI-Assisted 3D Design | Status: Complete*

## Context

My friend won a multi-month, hundreds-of-people game of Senior Assassins. While only a handful of people remained, he started conspiring with us, his friends. He quickly became someone we'd take a nerf bullet for. "Get down, Mr President" became our inside joke.

After he won, he invited everyone to a party and asked me specifically to make trophies and shirts to give out to everyone.

## The Challenge

*How could I make my friend look like the president? I've never touched 3D sculpting—how can I make him a trophy?*

## AI-Assisted Design Process

### 1. Generate 2D Concept

Used ChatGPT Image Generator to create the initial presidential portrait concept, combining my friend's features with presidential aesthetics.

### 2. 2D to 3D Conversion

Converted the 2D image to a 3D model using Hunyuan 3D-2.1 in Krea.ai, transforming the flat design into a sculptable form.

### 3. Manual Refinement

Cleaned up and refined the 3D model using Nomad Sculpt on iPad, adding details and ensuring printability.

### 4. Physical Production

3D printed and distributed the final trophies at the celebration party.

## Technical Workflow

**Tools Used:**
- ChatGPT Image Generator (concept)
- Krea.ai with Hunyuan 3D-2.1 (3D generation)
- Nomad Sculpt on iPad (refinement)
- 3D printer (production)

**Process Innovation:**
This project demonstrated how AI tools can lower the barrier to 3D design for non-experts. The 2D→3D→refinement→print pipeline made complex sculptural work accessible without traditional 3D modeling skills.

## Impact

Created personalized commemorative trophies that captured both the inside joke and the achievement, making the celebration more memorable and meaningful for everyone involved.
