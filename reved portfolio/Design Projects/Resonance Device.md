## The Problem

A strange paradox exists in our modern lives: we carry devices that connect us to the entire world, yet many feel more disconnected from themselves than ever.

We experience deep, complex, messy emotions but struggle to give them voice. There's a chasm between the richness of our inner lives and our ability to understand and express it.

### Current Solutions Are Inadequate

- **Therapy**: Essential but expensive and inaccessible for many
- **Journaling**: Requires discipline most don't have
- **Social media**: Forces reduction of complex feelings into performative posts
- **AI tools**: Impersonal text-boxes that don't create lasting artifacts

**The core problem**: No immediate, accessible way to transform beautiful, messy human emotion into something resonant and beautiful you can hold.

## The Vision: Resonance

### Not Another App

Resonance is a dedicated, physical object designed to do one thing beautifully: **listen**.

### Design Principles

- **No screen** - voice is the interface
- **Physical interaction** - simple knobs guide the experience
- **Dedicated purpose** - focused on emotional resonance
- **Tangible output** - creates physical keepsakes

### How It Works

1. **You speak** about what you're feeling
2. **Physical controls** guide the type of response (poem, music, etc.)
3. **AI processes** through three stages:

#### 1. Curate
Listens to nuance and searches extensive library of human art for resonant pieces

#### 2. Evaluate  
For each potential match, asks: "On a scale of 1-10, how deeply does this connect?"

#### 3. Decide
Selects the piece with highest resonance score

### Multimodal Output

- **Audio**: Reads poems aloud or plays music
- **Physical**: Built-in printer creates tangible keepsakes
- **Shareable**: Option to share with loved ones

## Philosophy

Art has always been humanity's tool for transforming complex emotion into something beautiful and resonant. But creating art requires skill and confidence most feel they lack.

Resonance democratizes this fundamental human needâ€”making emotional expression and artistic resonance accessible to everyone.
