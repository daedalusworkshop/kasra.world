- Spent hours building and tweaking an AI poetry generator, mostly by trial and error and lots of prompt engineering.
- Met with several teachers to figure out what they actually needed from AI (and what they didn’t want).
- Wrote up findings, reflections, and ideas—sometimes as reports, sometimes just as notes or articles for teachers.
- Vice President of AI Club, where I participated and won several Hackathon/Shark Tank competitions.
- Spoke at the English department meeting and basically said, “Hey, here’s how I think you could actually use AI in your teaching.” I tried to keep it concrete, not abstract.
    - For example, I told them about how I’d convinced my math teacher to use ChatGPT to write word problems that actually sound like something Gen Z would care about—stuff like, “If Mario Kart slips on a banana peel, what’s the second derivative of its spin angle?” (Okay, maybe less ridiculous, but you get the idea.) The point was to show how AI could help make assignments more relevant and engaging, not just automate busywork.
