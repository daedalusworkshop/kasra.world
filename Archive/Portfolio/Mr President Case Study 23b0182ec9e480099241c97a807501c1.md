My friend won a multi-month hundreds of people game of Senior Assassins. While there was only a handful of people left, he started to conspire with us, his friends. And he quickly became someone we’d take a nerf bullet for. “Get down, Mr President” became an inside joke.

After he won, he invited all of us to a party. And he asked me specifically to make trophies and shirts that he could give out to everyone.

*How could I make my friend look like the president? I’ve never touched 3D sculpting, how can I make him a trophy?*

## Process for Trophy
