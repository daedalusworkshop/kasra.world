The more context you give, the better an AI responds. Itâ€™s almost exponential. This is an opposite paragon to Google.

I recorded the meeting with the doctor, where I learned Iâ€™d be injured for my last high school athletic season.

I recorded a voice memo, where I just felt my feelings.

I texted a friend, too. He comforted me immensely.

I gave all of these to ChatGPT and asked it to write me some letters, coming from the different perspectives, that I knew I carried within me.

I gave it the emotional data. And it gave me back some letters that I knew were deeply deeply true.

This was the most Iâ€™ve ever felt from artificially generated writing.
