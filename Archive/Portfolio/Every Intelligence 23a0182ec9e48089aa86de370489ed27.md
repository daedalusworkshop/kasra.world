Every is a digital media company for curious builders, founders, and professionals exploring tech, AI, and the future of work. They publish essays, podcasts, and tools that deliver deep analysis and actionable insight.

But while their content is innovative, their search was outdated. It’s just basic keyword matching. That didn’t fit their audience, who use AI tools like ChatGPT to think and solve problems.

So I built a connector: in three clicks, you can link your ChatGPT conversation to Every’s catalogue. The tool finds relevant articles and explains how each one connects to your discussion, making Every’s insights more accessible and interactive.

I sent it to them through a cold email. I learned a lot.
