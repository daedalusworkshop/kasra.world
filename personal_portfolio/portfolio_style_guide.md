# Portfolio Writing Style Guide

*Based on lessons learned from Mr President Case Study evolution (v1 → v3)*

## Core Philosophy

**Target Voice:** "Telling a technically savvy friend about something cool you built"
- Not LinkedIn corporate speak
- Not overly casual "just chatting" 
- Authentic but shows you know what you're doing

## What Works (v3 Style)

### Section Headers
✅ **Use action-oriented, conversational headers:**
- "Figuring It Out Through Trial and Error" 
- "The Workflow That Actually Worked"
- "What I Got Out of It"

❌ **Avoid corporate buzzword headers:**
- "Process Development: Iterating Toward Success"
- "Workflow Optimization: A Four-Stage Pipeline"
- "Project Impact & Technical Learnings"

### Technical Description Style
✅ **Explain tech clearly but casually:**
- "White toner printing is tricky—you need the right heat and pressure settings"
- "Real photos are actually bad inputs for AI 3D generation"
- "This workflow turned out to be surprisingly powerful"

❌ **Avoid over-formalized tech speak:**
- "This specialized printing technique was essential for achieving proper opacity"
- "The optimized 2D input produced clean 3D geometry with proper topology"

### Problem/Solution Framing
✅ **Show honest learning process:**
- "What Didn't Work:" + "The Breakthrough:"
- "My first attempts were terrible"
- "I just needed to figure out how to use it right"

❌ **Don't sanitize the struggle:**
- "Initial Approach Issues" + "Key Insight"
- "Suboptimal results requiring process refinement"

### Skills/Impact Sections
✅ **Frame skills authentically:**
- "Skills I Actually Learned:"
- "Why This Matters:"
- "These are useful skills for real work:"

❌ **Avoid HR-speak:**
- "Technical Skills Developed:"
- "Professional Relevance:"
- "Key capabilities valuable in design and tech roles"

## Language Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Use contractions:** "I'd" instead of "I would"
- **Include honest reactions:** "So much iterating, oh my god"
- **Show personality:** "And made all my friends happy"
- **Admit when things sucked:** "My first attempts were terrible"

### Technical Content
- **Explain the 'why' behind technical choices**
- **Include specific tools/techniques by name**
- **Show iteration and problem-solving process**
- **Connect to broader applications without being preachy**

### Structure Patterns
1. **Human story/context** (why this mattered)
2. **Technical challenge** (what was hard)
3. **Process/solution** (how you figured it out)
4. **Results/impact** (what you achieved and learned)

## Image Integration
- Use `![[filename.png]]` format consistently
- Place images to support narrative flow
- Include both successes AND failures
- Let visuals carry weight in storytelling

## Red Flags to Avoid

### LinkedIn-isms
- "Significant technical achievement"
- "Professional relevance"
- "Key learnings"
- "Stakeholder management"
- "Cross-functional collaboration"

### Over-Engineering Language
- "Optimization pipeline"
- "Systematic methodology" 
- "Scalable workflow architecture"
- "Robust solution framework"

### Generic Portfolio Speak
- "This project demonstrates..."
- "Key insights include..."
- "The goal was to explore..."
- "Users appreciated..."

## The Litmus Test

**Good sign:** Would you actually say this sentence to a friend who asked what you've been working on?

**Bad sign:** Does it sound like it was written by ChatGPT for a LinkedIn post?

## Examples from Mr President

### V1 (Too Casual)
> "We started joking that we'd take a bullet for him. Like, you are our president."

### V2 (Too Corporate) 
> "Working with Grant as both friend and client provided valuable experience in managing feedback loops and maintaining professional standards within personal relationships."

### V3 (Just Right)
> "Grant was a great client to work with since I could be completely honest with him about what was and wasn't working. He gave really good feedback that made both the trophies and shirts way better than my first ideas."

## Next Project Application

Use this style for upcoming interviews:
- **Claude Opens Minds** (AI Tool)
- **Half Human** (Art + Tech)

Remember: Show technical sophistication through clear explanation and real results, not fancy language.
