# Mr President Case Study Interview

*Interview conducted: July 26th 2025*

## The Origin Story

**Q: Tell me about this Senior Assassins game. How did your friend become "Mr President" and why was that so funny to you guys?**

He was Mr President because this is a Senior Assassins game where you have to shoot someone with a Nerf gun. You have a week to find them and shoot them, and if you don't, then you are out. Most of my friends did it, and he was the last person in, so we were joking like we take a bullet for you. Like you are our president, and it's like he has a lot of aura like that's like I mean that in the Gen Z sense, and it's like aâ€¦ Of course we would support him. Take a bullet for him like it was really funny to us because he's also really humble, so you just nod when we say Mr President it's lovely.

**Q: When he asked you to make trophies, what was your first thought? Were you excited, terrified, or something else?**

When he first asked me to make trophies, I was excited and trepidatious because I had no idea how to make organic shapes. I was coming from that engineering background, so I was like, "Wow, how is AI going to be able to do this?" And I ended up having a really satisfying kind of creation of it that I really learned a lot from. Now I'm very excited about AI in the future of 3D modeling and 3D printing; it's so fruitful.

**Q: You'd never done 3D sculpting before - what made you think you could pull this off? Walk me through that moment of "I have no idea what I'm doing but I'm going to try anyway."**

I had done 3D modeling stuff and a little bit of AI-generated 3D models from images, so I was just curious and wanted to see what I could do. I knew I'd be able to figure it out, and the tech was good enough. I just had to refine my process for it.

## The Messy Reality

**Q: What was the first tool you tried that completely didn't work? I want to hear about the failures before the success.**

The first few iterations were pretty bad - they were messy, incoherent. Expressly was trying to generate different positions of him, but I was struggling and failing here. And then I realized I was giving it a real photo, which is harder to interpret than if I were to create a 2D generation of a photo created by ChatGPT that looks like a clay-like figure. That's more understandable to the AI that's generating the 3D model.

**Q: At what point did you think "this might actually work"? Was it when you saw the 2D image, the 3D model, or when you held the printed trophy?**

The 2D model was so crisp and I was like, "Okay, yeah, this is gonna work." And then the 3D model worked, and I sculpted it on my iPad to clean it up and do some finishing touches, but it was so nice. It's not something I would've been able to do by myself if I didn't have the 3D model generator, but it created a really nice clay that I could just perfect and polish up. It was a really fun process.

**Q: What went wrong during the process? Did the 3D print fail? Did the model look weird? Give me the disasters.**

Oh yeah, half the prints told you failed and looked really messy. I do love the final touch they gave it where I engraved acrylic plates that perfectly fit the base of the trophy. With the name and the award that made it look really nice.

## The Human Moments

**Q: What was your friend's reaction when he first saw the trophy? And what about everyone else at the party?**

They were like, "Wow, this is actually really cool." They were curious about how I made it. They all wanted one. It was great.

**Q: How much did this whole thing cost you? Time, money, materials - what did you actually invest?**

It costed maybe $200 because we haven't talked about how I also made shirts and I had to buy filament etc. It was I learned a lot and now I know how to do a similar thing if I were to in the future. The 3D model generation scale and the iPad sculpting skill or like the biggest takeaways. Let's talk about that shirt a little bit too.

**Q: Was this worth it? Honest answer - was the result worth the effort and stress?**

It was worth it. Not just because people had a great reaction to it. Not just because I had a great Instagram post where everyone was wearing my shirt. It was worth it because I learned so much in the process that I now have skills that I possess and I just enjoy the whole thing.

**Q: Tell me about these shirts! What did you make and how did that fit into the whole Mr President thing?**

This was the shirt I really enjoyed including everyone's names and making everyone feel like they are part of this. But still highlighting that Grant was the President and emphasizing him and giving him his moment. So much iterating, oh my god. Also, it was cool to work with Grant as a client that I'm super chill with. He was giving really good feedback that really elevated this project. We gave everyone a shirt and a trophy. Here's a group photo.
