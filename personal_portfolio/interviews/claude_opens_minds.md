# Claude Opens Minds Interview

*Interview conducted: [Date]*

## Core Story Questions

**Q: What actually made you think this prompt was needed? What were you seeing people do that made you think "there has to be a better way to help them see outside their bubble"?**

I'll be honest, I don't remember. But there is so much polarization. I was thinking politically, but in also other ways, especially in America, there's a lot of hard issues now and people are taking out the difficulty of them on each other. Look at what I wrote already. AI is kind of the perfect mediator. When people aren't already upset at it because there is some vehement opposition to it just by the nature of how it exists. I really like what I said in my original Claude opens minds page. I don't think we need that much information here. I could tell the story about my mom and how she used it.

**Q: What happened when your mom tried "What the Hell Is Water?"**

*(Note: The project name is "What the Hell Is Water?" - not "Claude Opens Minds," that's the goal. It comes from the "What Is Water" story.)*

She tried it. She talked for a few minutes about how much she hated Trump and why, and what her specific problems are. I was kind of interviewing her just to get out the things that I know would be good for this model to hear.

Then Claude gave a story about Winston Churchill, and she said emotionally, she felt less polarized afterwards. It's so interesting. I've noticed when I use it, it's not like a violent attack on what I believe; it's just a soft, really soft push. It's like I am water and I am red water, and it's just like a tiny drop of blue. So it doesn't feel invasive at all. But it's so satisfying how it gradually suddenly shifts what I believe.

**Q: How did you figure out that approach works? Did you try other versions that were too aggressive or didn't land right?**

Yeah, is that iteration? Trying to get the right format for the prompt. I remember I came across this whole thing because I had a long conversation with Claude that I was like, "Tell me a story that'll break my worldview a bit." And the story was so good, so interesting. And then I wanted to mimic that kind of format in a prompt, so that's what I did. Stories are way more interesting than like intellectual arguments in this context.

**Q: What was that original story Claude told you that made you think "oh shit, this actually works"? Do you remember what worldview it challenged?**

Humans have one specific, unique world view. AI has all of them. This gives AI the capacity to look at my worldview and find the opposing worldview and then kind of mush them together. It knows it's so that's so interesting. That's so interesting. And that's. The core of this project is that realization? Yeah.

**Q: Has this changed how YOU think about frameworks or disagreements now? Or is this just something you made for other people to use?**

Yeah, it's had this meta effect on me. It's opened me up to the different plausible explanations. Getting more specific. It frames my worldview as one of many instead of the right one. Even more specific to that. It softens the edges around my worldview. That's kinda maybe the best way to explain it. Makes them less hard, less abrasive. We need this in the world.

**Q: If you had to explain this to your mom (or someone else who doesn't know anything about AI), how would you do it? Strip away all the jargon - what is this thing really?**

You talk to the AI, and it'll try to understand where you're coming from. Then it tells a story from the absolute opposite perspective of where you're coming from. It's your job to collect the two perspectives and hold them together to make some narrative that allows both to co-exist in the world. It doesn't tell you anything. It just narrates a story. That's nice to listen to. And you're not doing anything but it does change you.
