# Interview Questions: Mr President Case Study

## The Origin Story
1. **Tell me about this Senior Assassins game.** How did your friend become "Mr President" and why was that so funny to you guys?

2. **When he asked you to make trophies, what was your first thought?** Were you excited, terrified, or something else?

3. **You'd never done 3D sculpting before - what made you think you could pull this off?** Walk me through that moment of "I have no idea what I'm doing but I'm going to try anyway."

## The Messy Reality
4. **What was the first tool you tried that completely didn't work?** I want to hear about the failures before the success.

5. **At what point did you think "this might actually work"?** Was it when you saw the 2D image, the 3D model, or when you held the printed trophy?

6. **What went wrong during the process?** Did the 3D print fail? Did the model look weird? Give me the disasters.

## The Human Moments
7. **What was your friend's reaction when he first saw the trophy?** And what about everyone else at the party?

8. **How much did this whole thing cost you?** Time, money, materials - what did you actually invest?

9. **Would you do this again for another friend?** Or was this a one-time thing?

## The Real Learning
10. **What's the one thing you learned that you'd want to tell someone else trying this?** Not about AI tools, but about the whole experience.

11. **If someone handed you $50 and said "make me a custom trophy," could you do it again?** What would be different now?

12. **Was this worth it?** Honest answer - was the result worth the effort and stress?
