# Interview Questions: Half Human

## The Big Idea
1. **What made you think "I need to trick people with AI poetry"?** Was this about proving a point, or were you genuinely curious about something?

2. **Where did you actually do this exhibition?** Was it a real gallery, a popup, your living room? Set the scene for me.

3. **How did you pick which poems to use?** Did you curate famous human poems, or just grab stuff you liked?

## The Experiment
4. **What was it like watching people read the poems?** Could you tell when someone was trying to figure out which was which?

5. **Did anyone get really upset when they found out?** I want to hear about the person who felt "betrayed" by liking an AI poem.

6. **What was the most wrong guess someone made?** Did anyone confidently declare something AI that was actually Shakespeare?

## Personal Stakes
7. **Were YOU able to tell the difference?** Could you pick out your own AI poems vs the human ones?

8. **What was your hypothesis going in?** Did you think people would be good at this, or did you expect them to be fooled?

9. **Did this change YOUR relationship with AI-generated art?** Or were you already convinced about something?

## Real Reactions
10. **What's the best quote you got from someone experiencing this?** Give me their actual words.

11. **How long did people spend reading before asking for the reveal?** Were they patient or immediately curious about the answers?

12. **If you did this again, what would you change?** Different poems, different format, different question?

## The Uncomfortable Truth
13. **Do you think this proves AI is "good enough" or that humans aren't as special as we think?** What's your actual takeaway?
