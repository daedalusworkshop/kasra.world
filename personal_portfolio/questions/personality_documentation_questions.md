# Interview Questions: Personality Documentation

*AI-Assisted Self-Reflection Project*

## Part 1: Project Story - The Human Experience

### Origin Story
- What made you want to mess around with using AI to map your own personality?
- Had you ever tried traditional personality tests before this? What was wrong with them?
- Walk me through the exact moment when you first thought "maybe AI could help me understand myself better"

### The Beginning (Getting Specific)
- What was the first conversation you had with AI about your own thinking? What did you ask it?
- Where were you sitting when you first tried this? What was that session like?
- What was going through your head when you started typing personal stuff to an AI?

### Reality Check Questions
- Come on, what went wrong first? Did the AI just spit back generic personality stuff?
- What was the first thing the AI said about you that made you go "wait, that's actually accurate"?
- What's the part of this story you usually skip when telling people about it?

### The Breakthrough Moment
- When did you think "oh shit, this might actually work for understanding myself"?
- What was the conversation or insight that made you realize this was different from other self-reflection tools?
- What did the AI help you put into words that you couldn't articulate before?

### Human Reactions 
- Who was the first person you told about this? What was their face like?
- What did people say when you explained you were using AI to map your personality?
- Did anyone think you were crazy or getting too deep into AI stuff?
- What did your closest friends say about the insights you were getting?

### The Substack Essay
- What made you want to write about this publicly in "Mind Mapping"?
- How long did you sit on this idea before deciding to publish it?
- What was the scariest part about sharing something so personal?
- What happened after you published it? Did people get it?

### Honest Assessment
- How much time did you actually spend on these AI conversations? (Be real)
- Was it worth the time investment?
- What surprised you most about what came out of these sessions?
- What kept you coming back to these conversations with AI?

### The Messy Parts
- When did the AI completely miss the mark about your personality?
- What aspects of yourself did the AI struggle to understand or reflect back?
- What made you feel weird or uncomfortable during these conversations?
- Did you ever feel like you were just talking to yourself in a fancy way?

### Emotional Stakes
- What were you trying to prove to yourself with this project?
- What would have happened if this totally failed to give you insights?
- What were you hoping to discover about yourself that you didn't already know?

### Money/Time Reality
- How much did this actually cost you in terms of time and AI usage?
- Would you do this again knowing what you know now?
- How long did you think this exploration would take vs. how long it actually took?

## Part 2: Presentation Strategy

### Core Value
- What's the most important thing someone should understand about using AI for self-reflection?
- If you had 30 seconds to show this to someone, what would you show them?
- What's the part that people always miss or misunderstand about this approach?

### Format Discussion
- What's the best way to convey what makes this project special?
- Should this be:
  - A technical walkthrough of the AI conversation process?
  - A personal narrative about self-discovery?
  - An interactive demonstration?
  - A philosophical exploration?
  - Something else entirely?

### Audience Connection
- What should the format be to make someone go "oh, THAT'S what this is about"?
- How do you usually explain this when people ask about it in person?
- What would make someone want to try this themselves vs. just read about it?

### Real Impact
- What's the one thing someone should know if they want to try AI-assisted self-reflection?
- What's different about this compared to journaling or therapy or other self-reflection methods?
- Looking back, what was this really about for you personally?

## Follow-Up Probes

### For Any Generic Answers:
- "Hold up - what made you think this was needed in the first place?"
- "Forget the big picture for a second - what was the first specific thing you learned about yourself?"
- "Who's a specific person this helped you understand better and how?"

### For Breakthrough Moments:
- "Tell me more about that exact moment"
- "What happened right before that realization?"
- "What did you say out loud when you saw it working?"

### For Honest Reality:
- "Is that really how you felt or is that how you think you should have felt?"
- "What would you tell someone else who wanted to try this?"
- "What's one thing you'd do differently if you started over?"
