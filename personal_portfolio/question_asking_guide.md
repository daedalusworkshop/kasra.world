# Question-Asking Guide: Getting the Real Story

*A guide for extracting authentic, human stories from creative projects (not professional LinkedIn bullshit)*

## Core Philosophy

**We want:** The messy, honest, human story of what actually happened
**We avoid:** Polished explanations, professional frameworks, sanitized insights

Think "telling a friend over coffee" not "presenting to a hiring committee"

## Two-Part Interview Approach

**Part 1: Project Story** - Get the authentic human experience of making the thing
**Part 2: Presentation Strategy** - Figure out the most effective way to show THIS specific project

Don't default to essay format for everything. Different projects need different approaches:
- Some need technical walkthroughs
- Some need visual demonstrations  
- Some need story-driven narratives
- Some need interactive experiences

Ask: "What's the best way to convey what makes this project special?"

## Question Types That Work

### 1. Scene-Setting Questions
Get them into a specific moment in time:
- "Walk me through the exact moment when..."
- "What was going through your head when..."
- "Picture yourself sitting there trying to figure this out - what did that feel like?"
- "What was the room like when you first showed this to someone?"

### 2. Reality Check Questions  
Cut through the polish:
- "But what ACTUALLY happened?"
- "Come on, what went wrong first?"
- "What's the part of this story you usually skip when telling people?"
- "What would your best friend say about how you handled this?"

### 3. Human Reaction Questions
Get real responses from real people:
- "What did [specific person] say when they saw this?"
- "Who was the first person you showed this to and what was their face like?"
- "What's the funniest reaction someone had?"
- "Did anyone think you were crazy?"

### 4. Emotional Stakes Questions
Find what actually mattered:
- "What were you trying to prove?"
- "What would have happened if this totally failed?"
- "When did you think 'oh shit, this might actually work'?"
- "What kept you up at night about this project?"

### 5. Money/Time Reality Questions
Get concrete about investment:
- "How much did this actually cost you?" (time, money, sanity)
- "Was it worth it?"
- "Would you do this again knowing what you know now?"
- "How long did you think this would take vs. how long it actually took?"

## Red Flags: When Answers Get Too Clean

**Watch out for:**
- "The goal was to explore..." (Too abstract)
- "This demonstrates..." (Too academic) 
- "The key insight was..." (Too polished)
- "Users appreciated..." (Too generic)

**Redirect with:**
- "Hold up - what made you think this was needed in the first place?"
- "Forget the big picture for a second - what was the first thing you tried?"
- "Who's a specific person this helped and what did they say?"

## Follow-Up Techniques

### The Dig Deeper
When you get a good story, don't move on:
- "Tell me more about that moment"
- "What happened right before that?"
- "How did that change things?"

### The Specific Detail Hunt
Turn vague into vivid:
- "What did that look like exactly?"
- "How long did that take?"
- "Where were you when this happened?"
- "What did you say out loud when you saw it working?"

### The Honesty Check
Make sure it's real:
- "Is that really how you felt or is that how you think you should have felt?"
- "What would you tell someone else who wanted to try this?"
- "What's one thing you'd do differently?"

## Interview Flow Structure

### Opening (Get them comfortable)
Start with something easy and personal:
- "What made you want to mess around with this in the first place?"
- "Had you ever tried anything like this before?"

### Middle (Hunt for the good stuff)
Look for:
- The moment of breakthrough or disaster
- Specific human reactions  
- Honest assessments of what worked/didn't work
- Real costs and trade-offs

### Presentation Strategy Discussion
**NEW:** Don't default to essay format - ask how THIS project should be shown:
- "What's the most important thing someone should understand about this?"
- "If you had 30 seconds to show this to someone, what would you show them?"
- "What's the part that people always miss or misunderstand?"
- "What should the format be? Visual? Interactive? etc"/
- "What would make someone go 'oh, THAT'S what this is about'?"
- "How do you usually explain this when people ask about it?"

### Closing (Get the takeaway)
End with reflection:
- "What's the one thing someone should know if they want to try this?"
- "What surprised you most about this whole thing?"
- "Looking back, what was this really about for you?"

## Voice Capture Tips

### Record Their Exact Words
- Don't paraphrase in the moment
- Note their specific phrases and expressions
- Pay attention to their natural rhythm and tone
- Capture the "ums" and hesitations that show real thinking

### Follow Their Energy
- When they get excited about something, dig deeper there
- If they gloss over something, that might be where the real story is
- Let them go on tangents - sometimes that's where gold lives

### Preserve the Contradictions
- Don't try to resolve inconsistencies 
- People are complicated - let that show
- Mixed feelings are more human than clean conclusions

## Example Good vs. Bad Questions

### Bad (Professional/Generic):
- "What was your design process?"
- "How did you approach this challenge?"
- "What were the key learnings?"

### Good (Human/Specific):
- "What was the first version of this that completely sucked?"
- "When did you realize you had no idea what you were doing?"
- "What did your mom say when you tried to explain this to her?"

## The Ultimate Test

**Ask yourself:** Would this question get an answer that could come from anyone, or would it get an answer that could only come from this specific person about this specific experience?

If it's the former, try again.
