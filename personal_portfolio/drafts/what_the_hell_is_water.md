# What the Hell Is Water?
*Building an AI prompt that softens the edges around how we see the world*

## The Fish Story That Started Everything

There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, "Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, "What the hell is water?"

This David Foster Wallace story captures something fundamental: we're all swimming in our own assumptions without realizing it. Our worldviews feel like reality, not perspective. But what if there was a way to gently help people see the water they're swimming in?

## When AI Has All the Worldviews

I stumbled onto this idea during a conversation where I asked Claude to "tell me a story that'll break my worldview a bit." The story it told was so good, so interesting. It didn't attack what I believed—it just offered this other way of seeing things that I couldn't ignore.

That's when I realized something: humans have one specific, unique worldview. AI has all of them. This gives AI the capacity to look at my worldview, find the opposing worldview, and then kind of mush them together. And that's so interesting.

## Testing It on My Mom

I built the first version of the prompt and tested it on my mom. She talked for a few minutes about how much she hated Trump and what her specific problems were. I was kind of interviewing her just to get out the things that I knew would be good for this model to hear.

Then Claude gave her a story about Winston Churchill, and she said emotionally, she felt less polarized afterwards. 

It's so interesting. I've noticed when I use it, it's not like a violent attack on what I believe; it's just a really soft push. It's like I'm blue water, and it's just like a tiny drop of red. It doesn't feel invasive at all. But it's so satisfying how it subtly shifts what I believe.

## How This Actually Works

Here's what the tool does, stripped of all jargon: You talk to the AI, and it'll try to understand where you're coming from. Then it tells a story from the absolute opposite perspective of where you're coming from. It's your job to collect the two perspectives and hold them together to make some narrative that allows both to co-exist in the world.

It doesn't tell you anything. It just narrates a story that's nice to listen to. And you're not doing anything, but it does change you.

Stories work way better than intellectual arguments in this context. Arguments make people defensive. Stories just... slip in sideways. This is what makes movies and art so effective. 

## The Meta Effect on Me

Building this has had this meta effect on me. It's opened me up to different plausible explanations. Getting more specific: it frames my worldview as one of many instead of the right one. Even more specific to that: it softens the edges around my worldview. That's maybe the best way to explain it. Makes them less hard, less abrasive.

We need this in the world. There's so much polarization—politically, but also other ways. Especially in America, there are a lot of hard issues now and people are taking out the difficulty of them on each other. AI is kind of the perfect mediator for this, when people aren't already upset at it because there is some vehement opposition to it just by the nature of how it exists.

## What I Actually Built

The prompt itself took iteration to get right. Trying to get the right format. I remember I came across this whole thing because I had that long conversation with Claude where I asked it to break my worldview, and the story was so good. Then I wanted to mimic that kind of format in a prompt, so that's what I did.

The technical insight is simple but powerful: AI can hold multiple worldviews simultaneously in a way humans can't. It can genuinely understand your perspective and also genuinely understand the opposing perspective, then find ways to bridge them through narrative.

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about politics or big disagreements. It's about recognizing that we're all swimming in water we can't see. The tool helps people step outside their own perspective just enough to see that there might be other ways of looking at things—without feeling attacked or judged.

In a world where everyone's edges are getting sharper and more abrasive, maybe what we need are tools that help soften them. Not to make people wishy-washy or eliminate their convictions, but to help them hold their beliefs a little more lightly.

Because sometimes the most important question isn't whether you're right, but whether you can see the water you're swimming in.
