# Mr President Case Study
*Developing an AI-powered 3D modeling workflow for custom trophy design. And made all my friends happy.*

## The Challenge: From Engineering to Organic Design

When my friend Grant won our school's Senior Assassins tournament—a semester-long Nerf elimination game—he earned the title "Mr President" from our friend group, for we'd take a bullet from him. He had that natural leadership aura that made everyone want to support him, and his humble reaction to our jokes just made it funnier.

Grant asked me to create custom trophies for his unofficial team, which presented an interesting design challenge: I needed to move beyond my engineering background into organic, human-centered 3D modeling. I was leaving the comfortable sanitized realm of CAD files and mechanical parts. I needed to capture personality and create something people would actually want to put on their desks.

The question became: How could I use AI tools to bridge the gap between my technical skills and the artistic vision needed for this project?

## Iterating Toward Success (Process)

I had some experience with 3D modeling and AI-generated models, but this project required developing a more sophisticated workflow. The tech stack was promising. I just needed to optimize my process.

**Initial Approach Issues:**
My first iterations failed completely. I was feeding real photos directly into the 3D generation pipeline, which resulted in messy, uncanny outputs.

**Key Insight:**
I discovered that real photographs are suboptimal inputs for AI 3D generation. The breakthrough came when I realized I needed to create an intermediate 2D representation—specifically, a clay-like figure generated by ChatGPT's image generator. This stylized approach provided cleaner geometry that the 3D AI could interpret more reliably.

## Workflow Optimization: A Four-Stage Pipeline

Once I refined my approach, the workflow became highly effective:

**Stage 1: 2D Character Generation (ChatGPT)**
Created a stylized, clay-like representation that optimized for 3D conversion.

**Stage 2: 3D Model Generation (Hunyuan 3D-2.1 via Krea.ai)**
The optimized 2D input produced clean 3D geometry, that was practical and viable.

**Stage 3: Digital Sculpting (Nomad Sculpt on iPad)**
Refined details, improved proportions, and added finishing touches using Nomad Sculpt, a stylus-first sculpting tool.

**Stage 4: Physical Production**
3D printing with multiple iterations to get prints high quality enough to feel like a trophy. I glued custom laser-engraved acrylic nameplates, which gave the award a really refined look.

This pipeline represents a significant technical achievement: creating a repeatable workflow that transforms conceptual ideas into physical products using generative design tools.

## Scope, Brand Identity, Client Collaboration

**Brand Extension:**
The project evolved beyond trophies to include custom apparel design. I created shirts that balanced group inclusion (everyone's names listed) with brand hierarchy (Grant prominently featured as "The President"). This required extensive iteration on typography, layout, and visual hierarchy.

**Client Collaboration:**
Working with Grant as both friend and client provided valuable experience in managing feedback loops and maintaining professional standards within personal relationships. His input consistently elevated the design quality and helped refine both the trophy and apparel concepts.

**Final Deliverables:**
- Custom 3D-printed trophies with engraved nameplates
- Branded apparel for the entire team
- Complete brand identity for the "Mr President" concept

## Project Impact & Technical Learnings

**Investment & ROI:**
Total project cost: ~$200 (filament, printing services, materials)
The return wasn't financial. It was educational and social fulfillment.

**Technical Skills Developed:**
- Created a clean pipeline for AI-assisted 3D modeling
- Proficiency in professional iPad-based sculpting tools
- Coordinating physical products with apparel design

**Professional Relevance:**
I learned some very useful skills through this project:
- Rapid prototyping with emerging AI tools
- Client communication and feedback integration
- End-to-end product development (concept → manufacturing)
- Problem-solving in novel technical domains

**Future Applications:**
The workflow I developed here is directly applicable to product design, character modeling for games/film, rapid prototyping for startups, and custom manufacturing. The combination of AI acceleration with human refinement represents the future of design workflows.

This project proved, to me, that 3D modeling has already been transformed by AI, in how we approach technical, design challenges.
