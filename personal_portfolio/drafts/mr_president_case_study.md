# Mr President Case Study

## When your friend wins Senior Assassins and asks you to make a trophy

My friend Grant won our school's Senior Assassins game. For those who don't know, it's basically a months-logo Nerf gun elimination tournament where you have to hunt down and "assassinate" your target. Most of my friends played, and Grant was the last one standing.

We started joking that we'd take a bullet for him. He had so much aura. Of course we'd take a (nerf) bullet for him. Like, Grant, you are our president. And he's so humble, he'd just nod and smile. 

We were all so stoked when he won. We wanted to party.

Shortly after, he asked me to make trophies to give out to everyone on his unofficial team, I was excited and trepidatious because I had no idea how to digitally sculpt. I was coming from that engineering background, so I was like, "Wow, how is AI going to be able to do this?"

## The messy reality of learning something new

I had done 3D modeling stuff and a little bit of AI-generated 3D models from images before, so I was curious and wanted to see what I could do. I knew I'd be able to figure it out—the tech was good enough. I just had to refine my process.

The first few iterations were pretty bad. They were messy, incoherent. I was trying to generate different positions of him, but I was struggling and failing.

Then I realized I was giving it a real photo, which is harder to interpret than if I were to create a 2D generation of a photo created by ChatGPT that looks like a clay-like figure. That's more understandable to the AI that's generating the 3D model.
## The breakthrough moment

Once I switched to the clay-like 2D generation approach, things clicked. The 2D model was so crisp and I was like, "Okay, yeah, this is gonna work."

Then the 3D generation went smoothly, and I sculpted it on my iPad to clean it up and do some finishing touches, but it was so nice. It's not something I would've been able to do by myself if I didn't have the 3D model generator, but it created a really nice clay base that I could just perfect and polish up. It was a really fun process.

## More than just trophies

Oh yeah, half the prints failed and looked really messy. But I love the final touch I gave it where I engraved acrylic plates that perfectly fit the base of the trophy with the name and the award—that made it look really nice.

But this wasn't just about trophies. I also made shirts. I really enjoyed including everyone's names and making everyone feel like they were part of this, but still highlighting that Grant was the President and emphasizing him and giving him his moment. So much iterating, oh my god. 

Also, it was cool to work with Grant as a client that I'm super chill with. He was giving really good feedback that really elevated this project. We gave everyone a shirt and a trophy. 



## Was it worth it?

It cost maybe $200 because I had to buy filament, shirt printing, materials—the whole thing. But it was worth it. Not just because people had a great reaction to it. Not just because I had a great Instagram post where everyone was wearing my shirt. It was worth it because I learned so much in the process that I now have skills that I possess, and I just enjoyed the whole thing.

The 3D model generation pipeline and the iPad sculpting skill are like the biggest takeaways. I learned a lot and now I know how to do a similar thing if I were to in the future. And honestly? Now I'm very excited about AI in the future of 3D modeling and 3D printing. This proved how fruitful it already is.
