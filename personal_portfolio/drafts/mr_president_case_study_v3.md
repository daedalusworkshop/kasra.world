# Mr President Case Study
*Developing an AI-powered 3D modeling workflow for custom trophy design. And made all my friends happy.*

## The Challenge: From Engineering to Organic Design

When my friend Grant won our school's Senior Assassins tournament—a semester-long Nerf elimination game—he earned the title "Mr President" from our friend group, for we'd take a bullet from him. He had that natural leadership aura that made everyone want to support him.

After he won, Grant asked me to create custom trophies for his unofficial team, which presented an interesting design challenge: I needed to move beyond my engineering background into organic, human-centered 3D modeling. I was leaving the comfortable sanitized realm of CAD files and mechanical parts. I needed to capture personality and create something people would actually want to put on their desks.

The question became: How could I use AI tools to bridge the gap between my technical skills and the artistic vision needed for this project?

## Figuring It Out Through Trial and Error

I had some experience with 3D modeling and AI-generated models, but this project required developing a better workflow. The tech was there. I just needed to figure out how to use it right.

**What Didn't Work:**
My first attempts were terrible. I was feeding real photos directly into the 3D generation tools, which gave me weird, uncanny results that looked nothing like what I wanted.

**The Breakthrough:**
Real photos are actually bad inputs for AI 3D generation. The trick was creating a 2D image first (I did a a clay-like figure generated by ChatGPT's image generator). This stylized approach gave much cleaner results that the 3D generator could actually work with.

## The Workflow That Actually Worked

Once I figured out the right approach, the process became repeatable:

**Step 1: 2D Character Generation (ChatGPT)**
Created a stylized, clay-like representation that would work well for 3D conversion.

**Step 2: 3D Model Generation (Hunyuan 3D-2.1 via Krea.ai)**
The stylized 2D input produced clean 3D geometry that I could actually use.

**Step 3: Digital Sculpting (Nomad Sculpt on iPad)**
Cleaned up details, fixed proportions, and added finishing touches using Nomad Sculpt.

**Step 4: Physical Production**
3D printing took several tries to get quality that actually felt like a trophy. I added custom laser-engraved acrylic nameplates, which made them look way more professional.

This workflow turned out to be surprisingly powerful. I could go from an idea to a physical object in a few hours.

## Making Shirts and Working with a Friend-Client

**Expanding the Project:**
The project grew beyond just trophies. I also designed and made custom shirts that included everyone's names while still highlighting Grant as "The President." Took a lot of iteration on the design for it to feel right.

I made the shirts myself using a white toner printer to transfer the designs onto blank shirts. White toner printing is tricky—you need the right heat and pressure settings, and it's the only way to get designs that actually show up properly on dark fabric.

**Working with Grant:**
Grant was a great client to work with since I could be completely honest with him about what was and wasn't working. He gave really good feedback that made both the trophies and shirts way better than my first ideas.

**What I Made:**
- Custom 3D-printed trophies with engraved nameplates
- Branded shirts for the entire team
- A whole "Mr President" brand identity

## What I Got Out of It

**The Investment:**
Total cost: ~$200 (filament, blank shirts, materials)
The payoff wasn't money: it was learning new skills and seeing everyone's reactions.

**Skills I Actually Learned:**
- Built a solid pipeline for AI-assisted 3D modeling
- Proficiency at iPad-based sculpting tools
- Practiced white toner printing and heat transfer techniques
- Figured out how to coordinate physical products with apparel design

**Why This Matters:**
These are useful skills for real work:
- Rapid prototyping with new AI tools
- Managing client feedback (even when the client is your friend)
- Taking projects from concept all the way to manufacturing
- Problem-solving with tools that barely existed a few years ago

**What's Next:**
This workflow applies to tons of stuff -- product design, character modeling for games, rapid prototyping for startups, custom manufacturing. The combination of AI speed with human refinement is where design is heading.

This project convinced me that AI has already changed 3D modeling in a big way. It's not just faster -- it lets you do things that would have been impossible or way too expensive before.
