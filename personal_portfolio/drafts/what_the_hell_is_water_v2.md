# What the Hell Is Water?
*Building an AI prompt that softens the edges around how we see the world*

## The Fish Story That Started Everything

There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, "Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, "What the hell is water?"

This David Foster Wallace story captures something fundamental: we're all swimming in our own assumptions without realizing it. Our worldviews feel like reality, not perspective.

## When AI Has All the Worldviews

I stumbled onto this idea when I asked Claude to "tell me a story that'll break my worldview a bit." The story it told didn't attack what I believedâ€”it just offered another way of seeing things I couldn't ignore.

That's when I realized: humans have one worldview. AI has all of them. This gives AI the capacity to look at my perspective, find the opposing one, and bridge them together.

## Testing It on My Mom

I built the first version and tested it on my mom. She talked about how much she hated Trump and his "poor character". Then Claude gave her a story about Winston Churchill, and she said she felt less polarized, less hating of the other side afterwards.

This prompt doesn't feel like a violent attack on what I believe. No, it feels like a really soft push. It's like I'm an ocean of blue, and there is a tiny drop of red. It doesn't feel invasive at all, but it subtly opens up my belief.

## How This Actually Works

You talk to the AI, and it understands where you're coming from. Then it tells a story from the opposite perspective. 

It doesn't tell you anything. It just narrates a story that's nice to listen to. You're not doing anything, but it changes you. It encourages you to create a new meta-worldview where both perspectives can coexist.

And for this, stories work better than arguments. Arguments make people defensive. Stories slip in sideways.

## The Meta Effect on Me

Building this opened me up to the ocean of possible perspectives. It frames my worldview as one of many instead of the only *valid* one. And in doing this, it softens the edges around my worldview, making it less abrasive to consider the other side.

## And we deeply need this. 
There's so much polarization, so many hard problems, and people are taking out that difficulty on each other. For this, AI is practically the perfect mediator.

## What I Actually Built

The technical insight is simple: AI can hold multiple worldviews simultaneously in a way humans can't. It can genuinely understand your perspective and the opposing one, then bridge them through narrative.

The prompt took iteration to get right, but the core idea came from that first conversation where Claude broke my worldview with a story.

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about politics. It's about recognizing that we're all swimming in water we can't see. The prompt helps people step outside their perspective just enough to see there might be other ways of looking at things.

In a world where everyone's edges are getting sharper, maybe what we need are tools that help soften them. Not to eliminate convictions, but to help people hold their beliefs a little more lightly.

Because sometimes the most important question isn't whether you're right, but whether you can see the water you're swimming in.
